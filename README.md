# Courses - Team TreeHouse Unit 10 Final Project

This application is a demonstration of using an api that was built using Node, Express, and the Sequelize ORM. This project is built using the React Framework using Create-React-App as the initialization tool. This demonstrates secure login using username and password authentication. The routing method uses React-Router-DOM to create a SPA application with routing for the auth signup, signin, signout, courses page, and CRUD opp of the courses. This project was a wonderful way to learn standard CRUD opp API utilization. The API used in this project was built as the previous [Unit 9 Project](https://github.com/tylerdh12/Project-9-TreehouseFSJ). This full project with the final submission can be found [here](https://github.com/tylerdh12/Project-10-Treehouse-FSJ)
